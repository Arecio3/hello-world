Hey Guys! My Name is Arecio Canton I've been trying to learn to code for a little over a year now and i havent been taken it serious enough, im not proud of all the time that i have wasted accomplishing nothing. I plan to change that this year i dont want to just look at this as a job but also as a hobby. Im lookinf forward to the constructive criticism from all of you.
